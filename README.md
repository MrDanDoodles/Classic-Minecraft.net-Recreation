# Classic-Minecraft.net-Recreation
This project is a nostalgic recreation of the old Minecraft.net website, using HTML and CSS to capture the look and feel from its early indie days. It includes functional links to archived Twitter posts by the creator, Markus Persson, and download links from the original site.
