# Classic-Minecraft.net-Recreation
This project is a nostalgic recreation of the old Minecraft.net website, using HTML and CSS to capture the look and feel from its early indie days. It includes functional links to archived Twitter posts by the creator, Markus Persson, and download links from the original site.

Description and Purpose
This project recreates the nostalgic look and feel of the old Minecraft.net website using HTML and CSS. Its purpose was to learn how to design a visually appealing homepage inspired by a game I loved. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in effectively using CSS and HTML with images to replicate a simple yet iconic design, fostering a deeper appreciation for the art of website creation.
